# Exercism Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from Exercism in the Rust programming language. Completing these exercises aims to improve my Rust programming skills and familiarize me with the language's features and best practices.

## About Exercism

Exercism is an online platform that provides coding practice and mentorship for various programming languages. It offers a wide range of exercises, each focusing on different concepts and techniques, to help developers improve their skills through hands-on practice and feedback from the community.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


```
.
├── README.md
└── exercises
    ├── exercise1
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── lib.rs
    ├── exercise2
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── lib.rs
    └── ...
```
Each exercise is contained within its own directory under the exercises folder. The directory name corresponds to the exercise name on Exercism. Inside each exercise directory, you'll find the following files:

Cargo.toml: The Rust package configuration file for the exercise.
src/lib.rs: The main Rust source file containing the solution to the exercise.

## Progress
I will update this repository regularly as I progress through the Exercism Rust track. You can check the commit history to see the exercises I have completed so far.

Happy coding!
